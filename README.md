Hello!
My name's Roberto!
I am a college student currently pursuing an A.S in Computer Programming and Analysis.
I'm currently learning a great deal about software development and IT infrastructure, and I am interested in game development.
I'm very excited to collaborate on projects and apply what I'm learning!
